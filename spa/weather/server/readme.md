# Weather App

This is a weather application that uses the WeatherAPI from RapidAPI to provide weather information.

## Installation

1. Download the project files.

2. Navigate to the server directory.

```bash
cd server
```

3. Install all dependencies.(But as it is a project submit so i am giving the node_modules all together so this step can be avoided. )


```bash
npm install
```


4. Start the server.

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:9310/](http://localhost:9310/).
2. The website has a search bar in the body where you can enter the name of the city for which you want to get the weather information.
3. There are two buttons under the search bar:
   - The first button is for searching the weather of the city you entered in the search bar.
   - The second button is for getting the weather information for your current location.
4. There is a settings button on the right corner of the website where you can select the unit of measurement (miles or kilometers).

## Error Handling

The application gives a warning in case of an error or if you enter a city that does not exist.
